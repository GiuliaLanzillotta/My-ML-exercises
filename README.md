# exercises
I'll group here some interesting exercises on machine learning-related problems. 

## Collaborative filtering exercise.

This comes from Computational Intelligence Lab class @eth during 2020 spring semester.
The exercise explores basic matrix completion/factorization techniques and exposes their limitation. 
Also, you'll find an hand-made implementation of SGD.
